 1.) Import math, and from math import pi to make use of the accurate value of pi.
 2.) Greet user through printed message, and ask user for a radius value through input.
 3.) Define user input as a variable (r), and assure it is evaluated so it may be calcuated properly as a float / int.
 4.) Create separte functions for each formula, and feed the user input into the proper formulas;
       Circumference: C = 2πr (C = 2 * pi * r)
       Area = A = πr**2 (A = pi * r**2)
       Volume = 4/3 πr**3 (V = 4/3 * pi * r**3)
 5.) After using the respective functions, make sure to have each result printed clearly.       
 6.) Give the user the option to restart the script or exit by creating another input based function.
