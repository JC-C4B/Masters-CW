

1.) Make a variable for your grid size, and number of ships
2.) Declare your grid/array
3.) Create a function to draw your grid/array
        Have it print the necessary rows and columns
4.) Create a function to set up the board before drawing it
        Have it label free spaces with a " . "
        Have it make 5 ships, and label their tiles with an " S "
        Assure the 5 ships are all in separate, random tiles.
5.) Create a function to check for a hit or miss using user input for a row and column
        Have it ask for a valid placement only if one is not inputted
        Have it prepared in case of an unknown error
        Have it return the valid values the user chose for row and column
        Have it change the ship " S " to " X " and print("HIT!") if hit
        Have it change tile to " O " and print("MISS!") if miss
            If the same tile is chosen again, have it repeat the applicable message
6.) Create a function to count the ships that have been hit
7.) Create a function to check if the game is over
        Have it take the ship count 
            Return True if ship count == 5
            Else return False 
8.) Create your main function
        Set up the grid/array
        Welcome the player
        Have the functions run while the isGameOver function == False
        Have the game break when the isGameOver function == True
